# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
This is a collection of projects that I do at The Tech Academy as I learn C# and the .NET Framework

## Projects

* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/TnTien/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
* [21 Blackjack Game](https://github.com/TnTien/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)

### Car Insurance App
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes in user's input and calculates a quote based on business logic.

### 21 Blackjack Game
This is a simple game of 21 made with C# and the .NET Framework. With the use of a SQL Database, we can keep track of the players and their money.
