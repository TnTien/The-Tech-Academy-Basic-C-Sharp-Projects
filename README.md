### Car Insurance App
This project is an MVC web application using C# and the .NET Framework that mimics a car insurance website. It takes in user's input and calculates a quote based on business logic. This app utilizes the Entity Framework to simplify that interaction between the application and the SQL Server database. The use of Razor syntax allows for a dynamic web page that provides different views based on the data.

### 21 Blackjack Game
This is a simple game of 21 made with C# and the .NET Framework. With the use of a SQL Database, we can keep track of the players and their money. System.IO Namespace is used to log the cards that have been dealt and to log exceptions into a text file.
